# Goal Model Editor

Goal Model Editor is a web application built on HTML, CSS, JavaScript with the help of Bootstrap, Jquery and Mxgraph
for the front-end, RestFul API and Node.js framework for the backend.

Goal Model Editor is used to help user create emotional goal models using following steps:

1. Upload pictures (of a brainstorming session) - containing do-be-feel list
2. Create goal lists - extract information from the do-be-feel list and create lists of functional goals, emotional
 goals, risks and stakeholders.
3. Clustering - put different goals into different clusters if they are somehow related.
4. Hierarchy - indent the goals inside clusters and merge clusters into one big hierarchy.
5. Generate symbolic goal model - use the intended list to generate the corresponding symbolic goal model.
6. Change the positions of the components on the generated symbolic goal model.
